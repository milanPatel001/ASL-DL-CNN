# American Sign Language (ASL) Dataset
The dataset is a collection of images of alphabets from the ASL, separated in 29 folders which represent the various classes. The training data set contains 87,000 images which are 200x200 pixels. There are 29 classes, of which 26 are for the letters A-Z and 3 classes for SPACE, DELETE and NOTHING.

## Objective
Given 87,000 images on ASL, the objective of this project is to develop and evaluate effective deep learning models for American Sign Language (ASL) classification, leveraging both custom convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning with pretrained MobileNet, with the aim of optimizing accuracy, efficiency, and generalization in real-world applications.

Dataset size is really huge. That's why it's not in this repository.
